## ðŸš€ About Me
I am still learning. Python is my starting point, I am just figuring it out as I go. I have one semester of college classes that really sparked my interest but I couldn't financially continue so I am continuing my journey of knowlege seeking on my own. There will undoubtedly be many bugs and redundancies, but making something workable at this point is my goal. I am curious to see what I can accomplish.
